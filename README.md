# Hailstone-Numbers
This is a popular conjecture with many names, for simplicity's sake, it is known as 3x + 1. The conjecture is that, as a summary, that you loop through, checking if a number is even or odd. If even you divide it by 2 or if odd you multiply by 3 and add 1. This is repeated until the loop of 1-4-2. This is gone through in more detail in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg) video
My code graphs the loop for any integer. I also added as many features as possible such as a step count and an infinite loop on it with a quit option.
